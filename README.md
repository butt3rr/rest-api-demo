# rest-api-demo

This task is a simple back-end application developed using Java with Spring Boot. The app provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a `User` entity. The application exposes a RESTful API to manage users, with fields such as `id`, `name`, `address`, and `phone number`. Postman has been used for API testing.

## Project Overview

This back-end application implements a simple user management system, allowing users to be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted using a REST API. The primary focus is to demonstrate basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for the application logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create the RESTful web services.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
- **Postman**: Tool used for testing the API endpoints.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed.
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or any Java IDE installed.
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (for dependency management).
- **Postman** installed for testing the API.

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included in this repository to help you test the API endpoints. You can find the collection in the `rest-demo\src\target\postman` directory.

### Importing the Collection

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the `Import` button.
3. Navigate to the JSON file located at `rest-demo\src\target\postman\Rest Demo.postman_collection.json`.
4. Use the imported collection to test the API endpoints.
